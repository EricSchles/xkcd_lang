#The XKCD Language

this simple class is based on the [types comic](http://xkcd.com/1537/) by Randall Monroe.  It implements all of the type stuff found there.  Other stuff will come with time.

##How to use:

```
from xkcd_lang import types

first = types(1)
second = types("2")
print first + second # returns "3"
```
